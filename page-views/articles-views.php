            <p>A vision takes shape as the indefatigable and hands-on WMSU President, Dr. Ma. Carla A. Ochotorena, together with CSSPE Dean, Dr. Blancaflor R. Jimeno, ESU Dean, Dr. Byron B. Go Silk, and Diplahan Campus Administrator, Dr. Carmela J. Go Silk, visit the new WMSU Diplahan Campus site. Here, the foundations of progress are being laidâ€”an academic building for the proposed BS Nursing program, which will house a nursing skills and science laboratory, alongside an administrative support hub.
            <br><br>
            This milestone is made possible through the unwavering support of Deputy Majority Leader, 1st Congressional District Representative, Atty. Wilter Y. Palma, 1st District Board Member Yvonne V. Palma, and the Local Government Unit of Diplahan, under the leadership of Mayor Atty. Eric Y. Palma, Vice Mayor Ramil Villaruel, and the Sangguniang Bayan Members. Their commitment to quality education and a healthier future fuels this transformative endeavor.
            <br><br>
            The WMSU Administration extends its deepest gratitude to our national and local government partners for their steadfast support in advancing education and public health.
            <br><br>
            Together, we dream. Together, we build. Together, we make a difference. Together, we create a better future for the community. (Aldrin Valerio, OP)</p>
